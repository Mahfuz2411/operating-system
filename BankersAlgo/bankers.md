Resourse number = 3
```
- step 2: Frequency of instances
```
Instances = 2 3 2
```
- step 3: Number of total process
```
Process number = 4
```
- step 4: Input for max need and allocated intencess
```
p0= 1 0 2 1 0 1
p1= 2 1 0 1 1 0
p2= 0 1 1 0 1 0
p3= 0 3 0 0 1 0
```
- Finally output
```
['p0', 'p1', 'p2', 'p3']
```
